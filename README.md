# Prework Study Guide

## Description

This project consists of a study guide and practical example of HTML, CSS and JavaScript code as well as Git version control. The primary motivation was to gain practical experience of these technologies, while also serving as a memory aid, which can be consulted should I need to remember particular code syntax. My primary goal in building the project was to explore how the different elements of a responsive web-page fit together and how to write, present and interlink HTML, CSS and JavaScript. While I already had some familiarity with each of these technologies, I nonethless gained significant experience understanding best practice in producing, combining and presenting these technologies. 

## Installation

No particular steps should be required to install and run this project. The HTML page, CSS and JavaScript should all run in a modern browser. Note that this project has been tested in Microsoft Edge version 106, Firefox version 105 and Google Chrome version 106. While the page uses relatively simple HTML, CSS and JavaScript syntax, I cannot guarantee that the page will load and function as expected in other browsers and browser versions.

## Usage

This guide consists of 4 sections covering HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript respectively. Each section contains a small number of notes and guidance on how to write simple HTML, CSS and JavaScript and how to practice version control using Git. The page is presented in HTML, with simple CSS styles and some simple JavaScript logic which iterates through each of the four topics and recommends a topic to study. Note that this logic and the outputs can only be seen in the console and will not be visible to users otherwise.
